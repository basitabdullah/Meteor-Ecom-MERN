# Meteor E-commerce

For Meteor E-commerce, I implemented a full-stack solution using a range of modern technologies. The application uses React for the front-end, allowing for dynamic user interfaces, while Sass provides modular and efficient styling. Zustand handles state management across components, ensuring responsive and smooth UI interactions.

On the server side, Express.js with Mongoose and MongoDB is used to manage database operations and API endpoints. Jsonwebtoken secures the authentication flow, and Bcrypt hashes passwords for user security. For secure payments, Stripe is integrated, ensuring reliable transaction handling. Axios facilitates communication between the front and back ends, streamlining data requests and responses.

Finally, Cloudinary is used for efficient image storage and management, making the E-commerce experience visually engaging while maintaining performance.
